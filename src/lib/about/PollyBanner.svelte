                    Polly Gaza has owned and operated RAW from the beginning and now runs the company with her daughter, Margo. She believes in the link between good food and our overall well-being. Inspired by the Living Foods Lifestyle she learned about over 20 years ago, Polly incorporates high-quality, uncooked, nutrient-rich foods in her diet on a daily basis. She has seen the power of raw food change her life and the lives of countless people around her. She is an advocate for using raw food to address any and all health concerns.

                    Polly believes that your body is a fireplace. You have to give it the highest quality fuel in order for it to burn the brightest for the longest.
