                    Margo Gaza is a Co-Owner of Raw, alongside her mother. Margo graduated from College of Charleston
                    with a B.S in Business Administration and Marketing. Growing up with a mother like Polly, Margo always knew
                    the importance of nutrition! She is fascinated by the science behind a whole food plant-based diet.
                    She believes food is your medicine, but also believes in eating a diet that doesn't take a mental toll on you.
                    Feeding her soul is just as important as feeding her body.
