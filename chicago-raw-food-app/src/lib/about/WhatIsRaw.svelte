                <p class='raleway'>Raw food simply means that we prepare high quality plant based ingredients -primarily fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds- that are not heated over 118 degrees. By keeping the ingredients from reaching high heats, all the vitamins and nutrients remain in the food before consuming. Raw food ensures that you’re eating food with its highest nutrient content.</p>
